“Sage” is a game about conquering hate using love, understanding and compassion. The main character - you - will join a magical cat, Sage, on an adventure as an ally for the City of Townsville, where you encounter people paralyzed by hate, fear, and anger. As you speak to them and heal them with your ally abilities, the city becomes a better place for everyone. But be careful, evil still lurks as Edward Hatt looks to spread his hatred to the citizens of Townsville. 

Players will encounter a variety of citizens and situations in the City of Townsville.  The player will act as an ally, educating fellow citizens on how to be an ally in a variety of contexts.

# Technology Overview
The Unity Container (Unity) is a lightweight, extensible dependency injection container. It facilitates building loosely coupled applications and provides developers with the following advantages:

- Simplified object creation, especially for hierarchical object structures and dependencies
- Abstraction of requirements; this allows developers to specify dependencies at run time or in configuration and simplify management of crosscutting concerns
- Increased flexibility by deferring component configuration to the container
- Service location capability; this allows clients to store or cache the container
- Instance and type interception
- Registration by convention

# CONTROLS

# ABOUT THE GAME  
### Description  
This game attempts to combine two great forms of video game: bringing the informative power of the visual novel genre and the flexibility of an open-world RPG. We ditched the open-world idea for the sake of time, but the idea was that you would be able to talk to anybody at any time in a 3D world and explore whichever dialog/character arc you want at your choice. We hinted at this a little with the 3D scenes between the dialogs.

### Ideation  
The whole team had fun brainstorming ideas for the game. The final idea was a combination of ideas from *Courtney Huynh* and *Akshay Mittal* and articulated as a whole by *Mario Gutierrez*.
